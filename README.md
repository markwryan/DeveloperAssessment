The tasks are not language specific, so please feel free to use any language you feel comfortable with and any editor/IDE you want.

The /tasks folder contains each task as a single Feature request, broken out into separate subtasks.

For each task, please create a new branch off of master. Once you have completed a task, please merge/rebase the code back into master and tag the completed task in master.
